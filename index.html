                  Welcome to my website! My name is Dipika Ghimire and I am a registered nurse with
                  licenses in both Nepal and the United States. I have a passion for helping others
                  and a strong dedication to providing high-quality healthcare.
                  I have a bachelor's degree in nursing from Nobel College and have completed practical
                  training in a variety of healthcare settings, including acute care, long-term care,
                  and home health. I am well-versed in nursing procedures and have experience handling
                  emergency situations. 
                  I have extensive knowledge and experience in various areas of healthcare, including working
                  as a staff nurse at Nobel Hospital and serving as a virtual medical assistant in the Children's
                  Endocrinology and Diabetes Centre in Georgia, USA. 
                  I am currently also teaching NCLEX to students at NCLEX Preparation Center Nepal, helping to prepare the next generation of healthcare
                  professionals.
                  I am dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest advances in the field and am always looking for 
                  opportunities to further my education and knowledge. I am excited to share my expertise and
                  experience with others and look forward to working with you to achieve your healthcare goals.

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 30px;">As a registered nurse with licenses in both Nepal and the USA, I have had
                  the opportunity to work in a variety of settings and roles throughout
                  my career. In the field, I have provided direct patient care in hospitals, 
                  clinics, and other healthcare facilities. I have also had the opportunity 
                  to work remotely, providing telehealth services to patients from the comfort 
                  of their own homes. Additionally, I have taught students preparing for the 
                  NCLEX exam, helping them to develop the skills and knowledge they need to 
                  succeed in the nursing profession. Throughout my career, I have always been 
                  committed to providing the highest level of care to my patients and helping 
                  others to succeed in their own careers. In the following sections, I will 
                  delve into more detail about my work experiences and the specific skills and 
                  knowledge that I have gained through my various roles.
